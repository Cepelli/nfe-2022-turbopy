=======================
*Time to complete: 8-16 hrs, depending on complexity of documentation that you choose to write* 

*Seminar date: 10:00 A.M. Eastern, Wednesday, July 7, 2021*

Prep
----
1. Read [Documenting Python Code: A Complete Guide](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/). The related video course is optional.
2. Skim the [numpydoc Style Guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).

Seminar Goals
-------------
Discuss methods of documentation, the importance of documentation, and how it is implemented in turboPy and other NRL projects. Review
some of the documentation that you created for your code submissions.

Homework
--------
1. In a sub-folder named `F4-lastname`, submit some code from one of your previous homework assignments with numpydoc formatted docstrings.
2. (Optional) Add a note to the notes section about something interesting that you learned about documenting Python apps

Notes
-----
Why should we document code?
- Documenting code helps others understand what it is doing, and so you can go back and remember what you did
- READMEs help users find the important information
