# turboPy-bootcamp-2021
This repo was used in plan, execute, and share materials during the 2nd running (Summer 2021) of the NRL turboPy Bootcamp for computational science and engineering with Python.

## Online learning and reference materials

The 2021 turboPy Bootcamp primarily utilized the following resources:
- [RealPython.com](https://www.realpython.com)
- [Svein Linge and Hans Petter Langtangen, Programming for Computations - Python: A Gentle Introduction to Numerical Simulations with Python 3.6, Springer, 2020](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-16877-3) - we refer to this text as "L&L"

## Bootcamp Schedule
### The turboPy Bootcamp ran June 14-July 19, 2021. The official schedule was maintained on Microsoft Teams.

## Seminar Workflow

1. Project Leader creates issue in this repo for their assigned seminars and adds a card to [`turboPy-bootcamp project`](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy-bootcamp/projects/1)'s `to do` column using the same title as the seminar markdown file.
2. First intern to review the material for the seminar moves card to [project](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy-bootcamp/projects/1) `in progress` column.
3. Interns do prep work and homework (if required) outlined in the seminar markdown file, including pull requests (PRs) to update notes and add homework assignments, linking to the seminar issue.  
4. Interns and mentors participate in seminar on Teams and any related activities.
5. Project Leader and Intern Admins assist interns and mentors to resolve any comments, suggestions, or bugs related to the seminar in the seminar issue.
6. Intern admins assist mentors to review and merge assignment submission PRs.
7. Each intern reacts to the initial seminar issue comment with `:tada:` (:tada:) emoji when complete with the lesson.
8. Once the last intern completes the seminar, the Project Leader for that seminar moves card created in Step 1 to [project](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy-bootcamp/projects/1) `done` column, closing out the seminar and issue.

## Reflective Writing

Throughout the internship, interns were asked to write short reflections on their experience. Topics and/or one or more questions for each writing were provided in the `RX` folders, and if comfortable sharing with the team, interns were asked to put them in the folder in markdown format in a file named `RX-lastname.md`. See templates/REFLECTION.md for the template.
