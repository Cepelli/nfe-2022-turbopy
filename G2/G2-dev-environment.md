*Time to prep: 30 minutes*
*Time to complete homework: 1-2 hours*

*Seminar date: 10:00 A.M. Eastern, Wednesday, June 16, 2021*

Prep
----
1. Scan the [Development Environment Notes](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy-bootcamp/blob/main/G2/G2-dev-environment-notes.md). If you are interested in using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), checkout [some notes on setting up WSL](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy-bootcamp/blob/main/G2/G2-wsl-instructions.md)

Seminar Goals
-------------
Become familiar with the default turboPy Bootcamp development environment (miniconda + git + VS Code).

Homework
--------
* Setup your development environment using the [Development Environment Notes](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy-bootcamp/blob/main/G2/G2-dev-environment-notes.md)]
* Read the following pages in the Visual Studio Code documentation:
  - [Editing Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing) 
  - [Linting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)
  - [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/debugging)
  - [Environments](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)
  - [Jupyter Notebook Support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support)
  - [Python Interactive](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py)
* Complete the [Getting Started with conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) tutorial
* Consider bookmarking the [conda cheat sheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html)
* Once you complete [G3 Git and GitHub](https://github.com/NRL-Plasma-Physics-Division/turbopy-bootcamp/blob/main/G3/G3-git-and-github.md), add a note below and add a "Hello, World" program (be creative) to this folder. Use `G2-lastname` for your branch, and `G2-lastname-` prefix for any files you upload. Be sure to push your dev branch to your fork of turbopy-training-2021, and submit a pull request to merge the branch in your fork with main in the repo in NRL PPD.

Notes
-----

* `# %%` can be used in any normal python script in VSCode to create a Jupyter-Notebook-like cell without having to create a notebook.
* conda environment extensions look for virtual environments located directly under the workspace folder.
* Virtual environments are useful for making sure programs run the same on all computers.
* `Ctrl G` can be used in any VSCode file to get to a certain line number via a prompt
* A [cheat-sheet](https://www.nobledesktop.com/learn/git/git-branches) for Github could be helpful to have handy until one gets used to using the command line. 
* Once you go through this lesson, you will have the tools in place to fetch, pull, and push code to and from local branches using `git`.
