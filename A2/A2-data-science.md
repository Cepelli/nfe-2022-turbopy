Data Science with Python
========================
*Time to complete: 60-120 hrs, depending on how much you experiment while going through the RealPython learning path* 

*Seminar dates:*
- *A2.1: 10:00 A.M. Eastern, Friday, July 2, 2021*
- *A2.2: 10:00 A.M. Eastern, Friday, July 9, 2021*
- *A2.3: 10:00 A.M. Eastern, Friday, July 16, 2021*

Prep
----
1. If you are using Visual Studio Code, and you haven't done so already, review ["Working with the Python Interactive Window"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py) up through the ["Variable Explorer and Data Viewer"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py#_variable-explorer-and-data-viewer) section. (*We will be using Jupyter-like code cells in VS Code, not Jupyter Notebooks.*)
2. Complete the RealPython ["Data Science with Python Core Skills Learning Path"](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/data-science-python-core-skills/). Lessons ***you can skip*** in the learning path: "Using Jupyter Notebooks" and "Data Engineer Interview Questions with Python." Try to copy most if not all of the code in the learning path into VS Code and experiment with it (either in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) or using
[Python Interactive](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) mode). Things you can experiment with include adding different types of plots and statistical analysis. Explore the [numpy](https://numpy.org), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) documentation to find things to experiment with.

Seminar Goals
-------------
- Part 1: Discuss code cells and interactive mode in VS Code. Discuss the first third of the RealPython Learning Path (through ["Pandas DataFrames 101"](https://realpython.com/courses/pandas-dataframes-101/)).
- Part 2: Discuss the middle third of the RealPython Learning Path (through ["Python Histogram Plotting: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas & Seaborn"](https://realpython.com/courses/python-histograms/)).
- Part 3: Discuss the remainder of the RealPython Learning Path.
 
Homework
--------
1. Add to the Notes section.
2. For each seminar, add at least one example of code that you wrote as you went through the Learning Path and be prepared to discuss it.

Files
-----
Use the `A2-lastname-` prefix for any files that you add. 
Create an `A2-lastname` subfolder to contain multiple files.

Notes
-----
1. Here's a resource to check out that answers [common NumPy questions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-numpy-practice-exercises-questions-and-solutions/).
