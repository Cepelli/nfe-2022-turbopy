Testing Python Apps
===================
*Time to complete: 8-16 hrs, depending on complexity of tests that you choose to write* 

*Seminar date: 10:00 A.M. Eastern, Wednesday, June 30, 2021*

Prep
----
In the [RealPython Test Your Python Apps Learning Path](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/test-your-python-apps/), complete the first two resources:
- [Test-Driven Development with PyTest](https://realpython.com/courses/test-driven-development-pytest/)
- [Effective Python Testing with PyTest](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/) 

Seminar Goals
-------------
Discuss what we learned about testing apps from RealPython. Review examples of testing in turboPy and other NRL codes. Discuss tests
that we created as part of homework.

Homework
--------
1. In a sub-folder named `F3-lastname`, submit some tests for any previous homework code. While doing so, try to accomplish these tasks: 
    - Create and activate a conda environment that includes pytest and any other package that you need
    - Use fixtures and parametrization in your tests
    - Exercise the test-driven development (TDD) approach to add a new feature to your code
2. Add a note to the notes section about something interesting that you learned about testing Python apps
